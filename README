  E Plugin for CakePHP


  ---- Queue is a CakePHP plugin for interfacing with beanstalkd, a fast,
       distributed, in-memory workqueue service.

  Synopsis
  --------
  This plugin was started with the idea that it may become a place for
  classes connecting to various kinds[1] of queues. However since ages there
  has support for beanstalkd only, which is a fantastic queue btw.

  Status
  ------
  Originally written for CakePHP 1.3 and maintained since as early as 2009 this
  project will not receive any future updates. There will be no port of it - lead
  by myself - to make it compatible with CakePHP 2.x or any future version
  thereafter.

  The most important part of this plugin has already been extracted and will be
  living under https://github.com/davidpersson/beanstalk.

  Thanks for all the support!
